            This project was built with Svelte Kit, which officially released in December of last year.
            The backend uses mySQL and Node.js
        </p>
        <p> 
            Why Svelte Kit? Because I wanted to use it. 
            Also it is the best Javascript Framework so far.
            Personally I enjoy it and I believe that everyone should do it.
